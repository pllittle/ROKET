Description: Perform optimal transport on somatic point mutations and kernel regression hypothesis testing by integrating pathway level similarities at the gene level (Little et al. (2023) <doi:10.1111/biom.13769>). The software implements balanced and unbalanced optimal transport and omnibus tests with 'C++' across a set of tumor samples and allows for multi-threading to decrease computational runtime.
